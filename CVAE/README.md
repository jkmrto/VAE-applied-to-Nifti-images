## Convolutional Variational Autoencoder

This repository contains a convolutional implementation of the  described in
[Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114).
The implemented model uses the MNIST dataset for classification in addition
to the ADAM optimizer, batch normalization, weight decay, and ReLU non-linearities.

### Dependencies
 * Python 3.5 or greater
 * Tensorflow 0.12.0 or greater
